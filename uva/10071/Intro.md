A particle has initial velocity and acceleration. If its velocity after certain time is v then what will its
displacement be in twice of that time?

# Input

The input will contain two integers in each line. Each line makes one set of input. These two integers
denote the value of v (−100 ≤ v ≤ 100) and t (0 ≤ t ≤ 200) (t means at the time the particle gains
that velocity)

# Output

For each line of input print a single integer in one line denoting the displacement in double of that time.
